With vast quantities of data at their disposal, businesses are facing a significant challenge in processing, analysing, and optimising it and doing this in a timely manner
In fact, more than three-quarters of UK businesses take a fortnight to complete this multi-step process, meaning by the time they get to the data it’s outdated. This is a problem that is in dire need of rectification, particularly as in these uncertain times, businesses need quick access to data and insights in order to adapt to rapidly changing situations. Therefore, eliminating lengthy and time-consuming processes to be able to adopt a data-first approach to business is essential.
The following three steps can help businesses in this endeavour, allowing them to put the processes and tools in place to turn data into actionable insights and deliver value back to not only their business, but also their customers.
Implement a data strategy
For many businesses, the focus tends to be on overarching organisational strategies as opposed to their top business priorities. But, to overcome data-related challenges, businesses must redress this approach, beginning by removing siloes and simplifying any issues they are faced with. The most effective approach to creating a data strategy will be to tackle one problem at a time – looking at one business outcome and then determining how they can solve it with data, rather than trying to build a data strategy without looking at how the outcomes are going to be achieved.
In taking this approach, businesses should identify their top three to five priorities, then solve them one at a time. This will ensure organisations are focused and agile, and that the strategy solves the most pressing problems before moving on to lesser issues. With a cohesive data strategy in place, businesses will be able to access and analyse their data quicker, and turn that information into actionable insights. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii.
